// Descriptions
"FireRateDescription" = "Is the frequency at which a specific weapon can fire or launch its projectiles. This can be influenced by several factors, including operator training level, mechanical limitations, ammunition availability, and weapon condition.";
"MagazineSizeDescription" = "Is the rectangular piece that holds shells for feeding into the firearm's chamber. High-capacity ammunition magazines, commonly defined as those capable of holding more than 10-rounds, make shootings more deadly. The more rounds a shooter can fire without reloading, the more wounds they can inflict.";
"RunSpeedDescription" = "Is the ratio between the normal movement speed and the speed at wich a player moves while running. A higher speed multiplier means that the player moves faster, while a lower multiplier indicates a slower movement speed.";
"EquipTimeDescription" = "Is the required time to pull your gun out from being holstered. It represents the duration it takes for a trained individual to successfully retrieve their firearm from its secured position and prepare it for use.";
"ReloadTimeDescription" = "Is the he period required for the player character to replace the empty magazine or cartridge with a fully loaded one, enabling them to resume firing.";
"FirstBulletDescription" = "Is the level of precision by a firearm when firing its initial shot after aiming or while transitioning from a stationary to a moving state. A weapon with high first bullet accuracy will exhibit minimal deviation from the intended target location, resulting in greater reliability and effectiveness when engaging opponents.";
"ShotgunPelletDescription" = "Is the small individual projectile or a cluster of projectiles that is discharged from a shotgun when fired. Unlike traditional firearms that fire a single bullet, shotguns disperse multiple pellets simultaneously, creating a spread pattern that increases the likelihood of hitting a target at close to medium ranges.";
"WallPenetrationDescription" = "Is the ability of a projectile to pass through barriers such as walls, doors, or other obstacles, maintaining enough force to potentially strike a target on the other side.";
